# Face Recognition Using KNN and SVM

This project focuses on implementing a face recognition system utilizing two powerful machine learning techniques: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Ma- chines (SVM). The primary goal of this project is to accurately detect known faces and display their corresponding names. If a face is unrecognized, it will be labeled as ”UNKNOWN”. This project also serves as a component of EN053403 Automa- tion and Robotics Project III.
